# STATUS — Steps 3–12a (desktop-first hardening)
Generated: 2025-08-23 18:50:41 -04:00

What changed since 2025-08-22_0255
- Playwright installed with html + line reporters; HTML saved at ui/playwright-report/.
- WebServer uses direct Node path for vite preview (avoids Windows npm/npx wrapper issues).
- Gate script supports -RunE2E, -E2EGrep '@smoke'|'@ui', and -OpenReport; e2e remains opt-in by default.
- README updated with testing overview and instructions to open the HTML report.
- CI Bandit -> pytest -> UI build is stable; report upload wired when e2e is enabled.

What remains before Step 3 (RecordRun / SmartAssert / Mock)
1) Ensure the four main flows advertise stable data-testid identifiers.
2) Confirm RequestId propagation/echo across endpoints touched by Step 3.
3) Verify lockfiles locally (CI already enforces); extend scenario docs after Step 3 lands.

Flake watch / risks
- Windows npm wrapper issues mitigated via direct Node usage in Playwright config.
- No tests quarantined at present.

Reproduce locally
